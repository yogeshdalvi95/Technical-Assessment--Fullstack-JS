# Technical-Assessment--Fullstack-JS

Backend and Frontend for getting current weather data based on https://openweathermap.org/api

Additional Improvements that would have been done if I had spent more time working on it.

1. The application look and feel could have been improved.

2. Could have showed more info on the dashboard alomng with the temp info with more graphics.

3. Could have added routing and when we select a city, could have also added that city in the url so that just by hitting the url the weather report of that city could have been generated.

4. Could have added lazy loading to the city select box.

5. Instead of showing add city in dialog, could have showed it in a different page.

6. Instead of showing prefilled cities, could have added a functionality where we type a name and results gets populated.

7. While adding new city, could have adde validation for duplicate city name also along with that a country name could have also added and validation of city name against country name.
